    <h1>The Jeep Renegade is a versatile subcompact SUV. 
      It doesn't offer near the off-road capability of its much more famous Jeep sibling, the Wrangler, but it does outclass many of its competitors when the pavement ends and the dirt starts.</h1>
    <h2>It comes standard with a 180-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and a nine-speed automatic transmission. A 177-hp, turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder is also available.</h2>
