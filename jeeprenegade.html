    <h1>The Jeep Renegade is a versatile subcompact SUV. 
      It doesn't offer near the off-road capability of its much more famous Jeep sibling, the Wrangler, but it does outclass many of its competitors when the pavement ends and the dirt starts.
    It comes standard with a 180-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and a nine-speed automatic transmission. A 177-hp, turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder is also available.</h1>
